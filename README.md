# R

Hey dude! Welcome to my repository `teachR`. If you know nothing about R,
congrats, you are at the right place. The repo should teach you some nuggets
of R. Noting more than that. Do you want the power of the R-verse to fully
unfold over your head? Well, then you should probably pilgrimage to the
`py-R-amids`. Nerd joke. Sorry, that keeps me engaged.

What else? Ah, the content will be in Englisch. Surprise, surprise. But why the
hell English?! Isn't that a damn German R-course? It is. However, I chose
English mainly for two reasons. First, familiarize yourself with this beautiful
and figurative language. It is and will be a loyal companion throughout your
career. Trust me. Second, I'm practicing for my Ph.D. So pardon my selfishness!

Besides, there are numerous reasons to tackle R this way. For example, English
the everyday language of the R-verse. All public manuals on CRAN, every
vignette, all help pages are written in–you've guessed it– English. Have a
problem, found a bug, etc.? Ask for help on `StackOverflow` or contact the
maintainer on GitHub in...(*hold on*)...English. I am running out of examples,
so I hope I have convinced you. 

Did I miss anything? Yes! If you want to enjoy my live performance on stage
Tuesday morning, 10:15-11:45, the course language will be German. In short,
repo lecture: English; course lecture: German. Maybe this nudges you to attend
the course. We will see.

Let's finish the read-me with a place for you to (re-)start. For the course, I
highly recommend the following two additional resources. I will draw heavily on
them. However, feel free to deviate from my suggestion if you find something
that works better for you.

## R 

You can download the latest R-version on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network,
see: [https://cran.r-project.org/]). Full-metal Linux users (like me), can also
utilize their robots package manager. On Fedora, for example, I solely run `DNF
install R` as root. If you have macOS, as I do professionally, you can use
Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) to simplify the installation process. Just hack
`brew install R` in a terminal.

## R & R Studio

R comes with a bare-bone programming environment. The R console is an
operational battle station but lacks user-friendliness. Try it yourself. Open a
terminal and type `R`. Do you know what I mean? Don't get me wrong; there are
good reasons to use R's rudimentary user interface (e.g., if you drive a
minimal-resource strategy). But we are not out for efficiency. We want to get
the most out of our R experience. That's why we will stick with a creamy IDE
(Integrated Development Environment) called `RStudio`. Don't get loose in
details. The only thing I want you to remember is: *R is not RStudio*. RStduio
operates on top of R. It provides a fully equipped, user-friendly environment
to produce R code. Neat isn't it! If you want to give it a shot, download
RStudio on their website (https://www.rstudio.com/).

## R-Studio Shortcuts 

Shortcuts are butter and bread for an efficient workflow. Within RStudio, you
can always find a reference under `Tools > Keyboard Shortcuts Help`. If you
want to remember only one shortcut in particular, try: `Alt + Shift + k`
(Windows, Linux), `Option + Shift + k` (macOS). Why this one? Well, it opens
the reference to all the others. If you like to view them in your browser,

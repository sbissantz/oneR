# R

Hey dude! Welcome to my repository `teachR`. If you know nothing about R,
congrats, you are in the right course. The repo should teach you some nuggets
of R. Noting more. Do you want the power of the R-verse to fully unfold over
your head? Well, then you should probably pilgrimage to the `py-R-aids`. Nerd
joke. Sorry, that keeps me engaged.

What else? Ah, the content will be in Englisch. Surprise, surprise. But why the
hell English, isn't that a damn German R-course? It is. However, I chose
English mainly for two reasons. First, familiarize yourself with this beautiful
and figurative language. It is and will be a loyal companion throughout your
career. Trust me. Second, I'm practicing for my Ph.D. So pardon my selfishness!

Besides, there are numerous reasons why you should be able to tackle R this
way. For example, it's the everyday language of the R-verse. All public manuals
on CRAN, every vignette, every help page is written in --you've guessed it--
English. Have a problem, found a bug, etc.? Ask for help on `StackOverflow` or
contact the maintainer on GitHub in...(*hold on*)...Englisch. I am running out
of examples, so I hope I have convinced you. 

Did I miss anything? Yes! If you want to enjoy my life performance on stage
Tuesday morning, 10:00-12:00, the language will be German. Maybe this nudges to
attend the course in presence. We will see.

Let's finish the read-me with a place for you to (re-)start. For the course, I
highly recommend the following two additional resources. I will draw heavily on
them. However, feel free to deviate from my suggestion if you find something
that works better for you.
